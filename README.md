# VROculusExam

1. Replace stones with multiple square objects of varying sizes. Allow stacking of 3 at a time and the stack topples / does not allow  if it is more than 3 
2. 5 lanterns are present in the scene which can be floated. After each lantern is released a counter goes up ( UI displayed on the screen) showing how many lanterns can be floated up

Extra credit - plant a seed and allow it to grow into a plant after 1 day cycle

Completed:
new BoxStackingColliding script [partially completed]
altered LanternBehavior script [fully completed]

Working with Box Stacking:
1. Classic box stacking for the 3 boxes.
2. Replaced rocks with 3 different colors of boxes for 3 stacks.
3. Implemented new UI element for the completed box stacks.
4. General outline/idea of toppling limitation/conditions and toppling function.

Problems with Box Stacking: 
1. Creating the 3 box limitation with toppling.
2. Creating the toppling method when 4 boxes are stacked instead of 3 (associated physics and reset)
